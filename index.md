### Projects during graduate study

[Project 1 Exploratory analysis and demand prediction for NYC taxi](https://xinyimsumyee.github.io/tanalyxi/)
This is a group work in my graduate course. This design aims to offer useful information to both taxi drivers and managers. The app we designed offers information about the average earnings of the taxi driver and which spot has more passengers. In this course design, I mainly design the app which explores the distribution of the NYC taxi and clusters by day and hours.

This project designs an app which displays the currenct situation of parking in Seattle and predicts parking demand in Seattle. We expect that this app can helps to ease the pressure of parking in Seattle. I did the model building and programing in this project and my partner did the design of the app.
